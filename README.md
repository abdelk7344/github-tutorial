## Git vs. GitHub
* Git allows us to take a "snapshot" of our code and does not require the use of github
* Github requires git and takes these snapshots and stores them in the cloud (a website)

## Initial Setup
1. To make an SSH key go first to [github.com](github.com) and log in
2. On the top right, click on your profile icon and press settings 
3. On the left side bar, click "SHSS and GPG Keys"
4. Create a new SHS key and give it a specfic and informtive title 
5. Get the SHS key from IDE. They usually starts with **shs-sa**. _( if using cloud9 then go to top right gear icon and press SHS key tab )_
6. Paste your SHS into git hub and press _Add SHS_ key
7. Go to your IDE and type `shs -T git@github.com` ( you should get a message stating your username and some type of approval message )
